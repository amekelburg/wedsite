### So the wedding's on an island?

![harbor view jones landing](/img/HarborViewJonesLanding.jpg){:width="500px"}

Yup, you got it! The wedding is on Peaks Island- about 15 minutes off the coast of Portland, Maine. There is a 3:15pm ferry that will take you over in perfect time for the ceremony, which is located immediately to the left of the ferry landing on the island. If you miss the ferry, there are water taxis available to the right of the ferry dock. You can find a more detailed explanation on water taxis on the [Travel and Accommodations](/travel-and-accomodations/) page. 

There is NO PARKING for cars at our venue, so please do not try to bring a car over. You will not need one for any of our wedding events! We will provide a ferry ticket for each of you (the return trip is free). It is important that we know where you are staying when you RSVP so that we can have the ferry ticket ready for you at your hotel or other accommodation. 


### What should I do with my car if I can't bring it to the island?

There are several parking garages near the ferry in Portland. The most convenient is the Casco Bay Parking Garage located at the ferry terminal. This lot is often full, so if it is for you, there's another garage that often has spots. It's called New Ocean Gateway Garage and it's located at the corner of India St and Fore St. 

For additional parking information, please see the [Travel and Accommodations](/travel-and-accomodations/) page. 


### What should I wear?

Our wedding style is casual yet romantic. No heels or ties necessary- this is not the Cannes Film Festival! We want you to feel great in what you're wearing. Here are some celebs who have graciously agreed to model appropriate attire for our wedding:

### Hey, what about my kids?

We are excited for **ALL** of you to enjoy our kid-free celebration, and also realize that most of you are not from the area, so we have done the work of finding a sitter for you! We will have two well-recommended and very responsible adults available to look after your bundles of joy for an hourly rate while you are kicking up your heels with us. They will be located at the 8th Maine Regiment Inn on the island, only a 10 minute walk from the ferry and our venue. We will be updating the website with the specific details as we work them out closer to the event, but do know that this is an option should you need it.
