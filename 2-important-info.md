### So the wedding's on an island?

![harbor view jones landing](/img/HarborViewJonesLanding.jpg){:width="500px"}

Yup, you got it! The wedding is on Peaks Island- about 15 minutes off the coast of Portland, Maine. There is a 3:15pm ferry that will take you over in perfect time for the ceremony, which is located immediately to the left of the ferry landing on the island. If you miss the ferry, there are water taxis available to the right of the ferry dock. You can find a more detailed explanation on water taxis on the [Travel and Accommodations](/travel-and-accomodations/) page. 

There is NO PARKING for cars at our venue, so please do not try to bring a car over. You will not need one for any of our wedding events! We will provide a ferry ticket for each of you (the return trip is free). It is important that we know where you are staying when you RSVP so that we can have the ferry ticket ready for you at your hotel or other accommodation. 


### What should I do with my car if I can't bring it to the island?

There are several parking garages near the ferry in Portland. The most convenient is the Casco Bay Parking Garage located at the ferry terminal. This lot is often full, so if it is for you, there's another garage that often has spots. It's called New Ocean Gateway Garage and it's located at the corner of India St and Fore St. 

For additional parking information, please see the [Travel and Accommodations](/travel-and-accomodations/) page. 


### What should I wear?

Our wedding style is fun and romantic. No heels, ties, or suit jackets necessary- this is not the Cannes Film Festival! Rachel will be wearing flats and Alex will be wearing a vest and collared shirt, no jacket. We want you to feel as GREAT in what you're wearing as we do! Here are some celebs who have graciously agreed to model appropriate attire for our wedding:

### Hey, what about my kids?

We are excited for **ALL** of you to enjoy our kid-free celebration, and also realize that most of you are not from the area, so we have done the work of finding a sitter for you!

**Meet CeCe and Katey:** Katey has cared for many children during her young and adult life, ranging from infants to pre-teens. She has also worked extensively as an administrator at a home for adults with developmental disabilities and behavioral issues. There, she has helped them learn life skills and has facilitated community inclusion activities. CeCe has worked as a teacher and as a Behavioral Health Professional with children with developmental disabilities and behavioral issues ranging in ages from 2-14 years old. Currently, they are both CPR and First Aid certified. They are also both legally certified [CRMAs](https://gateway.maine.gov/dhhs-apps/assisted/crma_overview.asp) in the state of Maine, so if any of your children require medication administration, they are more than qualified to take care of them! CeCe and Katey will be located at the [8th Maine Regiment Inn](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Jones+Landing/Eighth+Maine+Regiment+Memorial,+13+Eighth+Main+Ave,+Peaks+Island,+ME+04108/@43.654204,-70.1976256,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0x66eeb521011470ef!2m2!1d-70.1988746!2d43.6557438!1m5!1m1!1s0x4cb29d9197ff66f3:0x7c1c54919956cb64!2m2!1d-70.191974!2d43.652719!3e2) on the island, only a 10 minute walk from the ferry, and they have agreed to charge $50 for one child or $75 for two children for the whole night, 3:30-9:45pm.
