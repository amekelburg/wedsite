After the wedding, we'll be enjoying a little sun and sand on York Beach before heading home to Boston. We'll be staying two nights (Sunday and Monday) at the [Union Bluff](http://www.unionbluff.com/) hotel where Alex has spent many vacations with his parents.

If you're up for extending the weekend celebration, please join us for some R&R on the beach!
