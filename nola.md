### Events

[Buy Jazz Fest Tickets](http://www.nojazzfest.com/tickets/)

#### Thursday, April 21

* Get settled
* **1:30pm**

  We have lunch reservations at [Commander's Palace](http://www.commanderspalace.com/). There is a dress code: gentlemen are required to wear a collared shirt and dress shoes, jackets are preferred. Women must be in "business attire" aka skirt or dress or pantsuit. No flip-flops, shorts, tshirts, or sweats allowed and jeans are strongly discouraged. All that said, this place has amazing food and 25¢ martinis, so it's worth it to dress up a bit even if it's not your jam! We are aware that some of you are coming into NOLA around or after that time, and we are sorry that you won't be able to join us - they couldn't accommodate a group our size (we are 26 people!) so we ended up with this reservation as our only option. 
  
* Explore the French Quarter with To-Go drinks
* Frenchman St jazz & Dinner
  Dinner is currently unplanned, and we will happily take suggestions if you're familiar with the area. In the evening, we will likely be strolling down Frenchman Street where all the jazz clubs are, stopping in wherever sounds good... literally! Dress is casual.
  
#### Friday, April 22

* Begneits and Coffee!
* Currently, Friday for lunch is unplanned, so if you are truly saddened to be missing the Thursday [Commander's Palace](http://www.commanderspalace.com/) lunch, please feel free to make your own reservations for Friday and enjoy all the things then!! But if you'd like to do this, do it soon - reservations book up fast. 
* Perhaps we will meander the French quarter, perhaps we will explore [Jazz Fest](http://lineup.nojazzfest.com/?sort=FridayApril22). Steely Dan is playing Friday! We have not purchased tickets yet, but it's not any more expensive at the door (after the online fees), so we'll play it by ear (no pun intended!). 
* **5:00pm** 

  We have reservations **FOR ALL 26 OF US** at Superior [Seafood and Oyster Bar](http://www.superiorseafoodnola.com/) where they will be preparing a crawfish boil for us! It is also happy hour there from 4-6:30pm with half-priced house wine and 50¢ oysters, so it will be an excellent time had by all. Dress is casual.

* Friday night: there will be two options:
  1. Rachel will be doing a classic Bourbon Street bachelorette evening! Anyone (guys or ladies) who would like to join is welcome!! Dress to kill! Rachel will be wearing a sparkly sequin top and tulle skirt with heels - you do what makes you feel fabulous. Be prepared to have a good time. ;)
  2. Alex will be doing what Alex does best: jazz and drinking! He will be heading back to Frenchmen Street and hitting the jazz clubs because there's endless amounts of amazing music in NOLA and great whiskey at d.b.a. You wear what you want.


#### Saturday, April 23

* Our only plan is [Jazz Fest](http://lineup.nojazzfest.com/?sort=SaturdayApril23). Pearl Jam is playing and Rachel, for one, is STOKED. Jazz Fest is held in a park, and tickets are basically an entrance fee for the all-day open-air festival event. Pack sunscreen and perhaps a hat. Dress comfortably, especially footwear.


Sunday, April 24

* Rachel & Alex fly back north in the late morning/early afternoon. If you're staying in the area, the Red Hot Chili Peppers will be at [Jazz Fest](http://lineup.nojazzfest.com/?sort=SundayApril24) on Sunday. Enjoy them for Rachel - she is devastated to be missing them.
