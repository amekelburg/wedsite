### Our Love Story

<div class='editable'>
In October of 2013, the bride's stepsister, Molly was getting married. As a bridesmaid, Rachel offered to help with last minute preparations. While stamping table numbers on the colorful buttons, she noticed one name she did not recognize placed at her table. "Who's this Alex Mekelburg fellow," she asked. Without skipping a beat, Molly answered, "He's the sax player in the band. He's single and really cute and I wouldn't mind if he was my future brother-in-law." Subtle, Mol. ðŸ’—

As guests started settling into the reception hall and placing their buttons at their tables on the big day, Alex mysteriously found himself sandwiched between Rachel and another bridesmaid, Caroline, at their table (seriously, we still don't know who switched around the buttons!). Caroline made an excellent wing-woman, asking Alex all the get-to-know-you questions so that Rachel didn't awkwardly have to. At one point, Alex got up from the table, and in his absence, Rachel leaned over to Caroline and exclaimed, "He's really cute!" What she did not realize was that a good friend and fellow band member, Steve, was still sitting at the table when she said it. He, of course, promptly told Alex of Rachel's adoration. At the end of the night, Molly came up to Alex and asked, "So are you in love with my sister yet?" Alex smiled. "Not yet..."

Through the powers of Facebook and the allure of Boston and the New England Patriots, their courtship continued and love blossomed with the ease of two people meant for each other.

### The Proposal

Alex and Rachel planned a trip to St. Croix for Rachel's February school break this past year. They flew from Boston to Baltimore on Friday, Feb 13th, from Baltimore to San Juan on Saturday, Feb 14th, and by Sunday they would be in St. Croix. With Saturday being Valentines Day, Alex and Rachel decided to stay in the Intercontinental right on the beach, to add a little extra romance. Last year, they decided to make nachos and champagne the Valentine's Day tradition, so that night they walked along the beach to get their takeout nachos. Alex had previously arranged for a bottle of Mo&euml;t et Chandon to be waiting chilled in their room. After an excellent meal, they decided to open their Valentines cards. Alex's card was beautifully written, telling Rachel about how happy she makes him and all the ways they work so well together. Alex finished the card by writing, "And now there's one more thing I'd like to add to make this day ours," and he dug his hand into the couch cushions, pulled out a ring box, and said to her, "Rachel Leigh Schillhammer, will you marry me?" Overjoyed, Rachel threw her arms around him and nodded "Yes," into his shoulder.
