### Rehearsal Dinner (Times TBD)

There will be a ceremony run-through at 5pm(?) at the venue for those in the wedding party. A lobster bake dinner will follow at the Peak's Island Lion's Club. The venue is BYOB and we'll have plenty of beer, wine and other things, but feel free to bring anything you may particularly want. After dinner, any one else in town is welcome to join the party for drinks and snacks!
